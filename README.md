# Simple Mod Framework (for GamePass / Mircosoft Store)
## About this Fork
This fork only supports the Microsoft Store / GamePass version of Hitman 3
## Setup
You need to have Hitman 3 installed in a location that isn't WindowsApps, you can use the Xbox app to move your current install.
1. Do some permission magic (tutorial coming soon)
2. Place the extracted `release` folder into your `PC - HITMAN 3 - Base Game\Content\Retail` folder and rename it to `Simple Mod Framework`
3. Open the `Simple Mod Framework` folder and double click on `Mod Manager.cmd`
4. Profit
